Practice network operations

### 1-1 Basic operations of network (Using network1, network2)
  1. calculate the number of nodes and edges
  2. determine if the network is simple or not
    a. if not simple, list all the self-loops and multi-edges
  3. list all the neighbors of node e and c in the network 1 and 2 respectively
    a. if not simple, the duplicated neighbors and self-neighbors must be listed
  4. design a function to check if the inputted two nodes are adjacent

### 1-2 Directed graph analysis (Using network1, network2)
  1. calculate the in-degree sequence and out-degree sequence of them
  2. check their connectivity, i.e. strongly or weakly connected
  3. calculate the distance between node a and node i
  4. list one subgraph containing at least 5 nodes for each network
    a. The listed subgraphs must be weakly connected
