# Biological-Network-Analysis

Practice various network operations

### 1-1 (Using network1, network2)
  1. calculate the number of nodes and edges
  2. determine if the network is simple or not
    a. if not simple, list all the self-loops and multi-edges
  3. list all the neighbors of node e and c in the network 1 and 2 respectively
    a. if not simple, the duplicated neighbors and self-neighbors must be listed
  4. design a function to check if the inputted two nodes are adjacent
